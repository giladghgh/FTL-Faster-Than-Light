# FTL: Faster Than Light visualised
Inspired by the defunct [FLT-AV mod](https://github.com/Niels-NTG/FTLAV)—which I tried and failed to get working myself—I recorded & visualised game data for a single high-difficulty run.

For the uninitiated, **FTL: Faster Than Light** is what's known as a _roguelike_ game; you operate in a turn-based, randomly generated world where you attempt to complete your mission in distinct 'runs', since dying on a run wipes all progress, loot collected, weapons bought, etc. This visualisation tracks as much data as I could record for a single run.

The run itself was dicey; I barely made any use of ship augmentations, an embarrassing number of enemy ships escaped, my hull got to 1HP twice, and I died almost immediately on contact with the flagship's first barrage. Hopefully the visuals distract from this glaring lack of skill.

The `.twbx` packaged workbook contains all media and data extract files for your convenience, and I also provide the standard `.twb` file.
I recommend you download the workbook (if you have [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/products/trial)) so it runs at a good pace. If you're unsure what something is—despite my best efforts to make it intuitive—just hover the cursor over it and a tooltip will most likely appear :)
